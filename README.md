# Virtual Drum Kit Web Application

This is a simple web application that simulates a drum kit. You can play different drum sounds by either clicking the buttons on the screen or by pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard.

## How to Use

### Button Clicks

Click on the drum buttons on the web page to play sounds.

### Keyboard Input

You can also use your keyboard to play sounds. Each key corresponds to a specific drum sound:

- "W" key: Crash
- "A" key: Tom 2
- "S" key: Tom 3
- "D" key: Tom 4
- "J" key: Tom 1
- "K" key: Kick Bass
- "L" key: Snare

When you trigger a sound, the associated button will briefly animate to provide a visual feedback effect.

Feel free to experiment and create your own drum beats with this simple drum kit web app!
